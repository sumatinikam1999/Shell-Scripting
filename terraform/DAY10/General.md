In Terraform, when you create a security group, you specify which IP addresses (or range of IPs) are allowed to access your EC2 instance.

cidr_blocks means: "What IP addresses are allowed?"

["0.0.0.0/0"] means: "Allow everyone in the world to access this."

CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, and it's used to define IP ranges.

A.B.C.D/Mask
Example: 192.168.1.0/24
0.0.0.0/0 = Everyone (public internet)

192.168.1.0/24 = IPs from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255

10.0.0.0/16 = IPs from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255 (used in private networks)


CIDR Block	Meaning
0.0.0.0/0	Everyone (public internet)
192.168.1.0/24	IPs from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255
10.0.0.0/16	Private IPs from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255
x.x.x.x/32	Only 1 specific IP allowed


CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It’s a way to specify a range of IP addresses using a format like:

Copy
Edit
IP_address/Prefix_Length
Example: 192.168.1.0/24

Format:
mathematica
Copy
Edit
A.B.C.D/E
A.B.C.D: Base IP address (starting point)

/E: Number of fixed bits in the network (mask length)

🔍 Examples Explained:
✅ 1. 192.168.1.0/24
/24 means first 24 bits are fixed (network part)

Remaining bits (32 - 24 = 8 bits) are for hosts

So:

2⁸ = 256 addresses

Range: 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255

✅ 2. 10.0.0.0/16
/16 means first 16 bits are fixed

Remaining 16 bits → 2¹⁶ = 65536 IPs

Range: 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255

📐 How to Calculate IP Range from CIDR
Let’s say we have: X.Y.Z.0/N

Count host bits = 32 - N

Number of IPs = 2 ^ (32 - N)

Use the starting IP to list all IPs (or check range using subnet calculator)

🔧 Tools to Use
You don’t need to calculate by hand always. You can use:

🔗 ipcalc on Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install ipcalc
ipcalc 192.168.1.0/24
🎯 In Terraform Security Groups
When you write:

hcl
Copy
Edit
cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
It means:

Allow traffic from any IP address (entire internet).

For private networks:

192.168.0.0/16 – All private 192.168.x.x IPs

10.0.0.0/8 – All private 10.x.x.x IPs

📌 Summary
CIDR	IP Range Covered	Total IPs
192.168.1.0/24	192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255	256
10.0.0.0/16	10.0.0.0 - 10.0.255.255	65,536
0.0.0.0/0	All possible IPs (entire internet)	~4.3 billion
