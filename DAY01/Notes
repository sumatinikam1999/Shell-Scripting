## **Without Shell Scripting**
1) Manual Installations  
2) Time Consuming  
3) Human Error  

If we want to do anything in Linux it will go through Shell

```
Python is application inside Linux, but Shell is native scripting of Linux server
```

Python is also like applying one layer on top of Shell

Automations inside Linux are Internal -> Shell Scripting  
Automations outside Linux are External -> Python
